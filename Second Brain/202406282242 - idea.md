### Cool box

##### Keep electronics and other temperature sensitive items cool when they have to be left in a hot environment like in a car on a summer day.

- A lockable box/container with a solar panel on top.
- The solar panel powers peltier TEC's and a fan.
- Leave the device in full sun.
- As more sun hits the device the TEC and fan activate to keep the inside of the box relatively cooler than the outside environment.
